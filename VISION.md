# VaultSpace

## Overview

VaultSpace is a unified cloud storage system built on top of multiple Google accounts.

Google provides 15GB of free storage per account. When storage fills up, users typically have two choices:

1. Upgrade to a paid Google One plan.
2. Create additional free Google accounts and manually manage them.

VaultSpace focuses on the second approach — but removes the manual complexity.

## The Storage Options

### Option 1: Google One (Paid)

Upgrading with Google One provides:

- A single account
- Simple management
- Higher storage limits

However:

- It requires a monthly subscription.
- Storage is still limited by the selected plan.
- More storage means higher recurring cost.

---

### Option 2: Multiple Free Google Accounts

Each Google account includes:

- 15GB of free storage

By creating additional accounts, users can increase total available storage without paying.

This approach works technically. Users can:
- Share folders between accounts
- Upload files from different accounts
- Expand storage capacity over time

However, managing multiple accounts manually requires coordination and effort.

Users must:
- Track storage usage per account
- Decide which account to upload to
- Manage folder sharing correctly
- Handle permissions properly
- Switch accounts when needed

It is possible — but not automated.

## What VaultSpace Does

VaultSpace automates multi-account cloud storage management.

It does not create new storage.
It organizes and coordinates the storage users already have.

VaultSpace:

- Connects multiple Google accounts
- Automatically configures sharing permissions
- Combines storage into a unified system
- Displays total available storage in one place
- Automatically selects an account for uploads based on available space
- Tracks usage distribution across accounts

Instead of manually managing accounts, the app handles the coordination logic.

## Expanding Storage

When additional storage is needed:

- A new Google account can be created or added
- The account is connected inside the app
- Sharing is configured automatically
- The account immediately becomes part of the unified storage pool

No manual folder setup.
No manual sharing.
No manual coordination.

## Core Idea

VaultSpace transforms multiple independent Google accounts into a single, organized, expandable cloud storage system.

It removes manual management effort while preserving the flexibility of free Google storage.

## One-Sentence Summary

VaultSpace automates and unifies multiple free Google accounts into a single expandable cloud storage system.
